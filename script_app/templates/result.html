                        Out of the {{ file_type1 }} Sentences/Words etc, you need to <u><b style="color:red">modify at least {{ file_type2 }}</b></u>, which amounts to <mark><b>a minimum of {{ file_type3 }} Sentences/Words</b></mark> etc. <br>
                        This task requires to be translated into <u><b>one translation</b> per source text</u>. <br>
                        *Task type: MTPE <br>
                        In the column for the first translation (Column D), Machine-Translated sentences are provided. <br>
                        Please modify, edit, correct, or change the provided MT to be correct in meaning. <br>
                        <br>
                        ✓ Please correct it <u>directly in <b>column D</b></u>. (Do not edit column E and F.) <br>
                        Column E (Edited): When modifying a given machine translation, "N" is converted to "Y", and the cell turns green. <br>
                        Column F (mt_sim): If the translation you wrote after modification is the same as the translation provided by the above-mentioned machine translator, the cell turns red as "P" is converted to "F". <br>
                        <br>
                        The purpose is not to correct mistranslations but to collect alternative versions of translations different from machine translations. <br>
                        Therefore, please make maximum use of synonyms, related terms, and similar expressions when making the modifications.
